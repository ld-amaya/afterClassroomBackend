## ABOUT
We all know the pandemic brought us a new normal, and lucky for some sectors or organization who have been built to handle work-from-home or remote work. But for most of the business, especially schools from third world country like the Philippines, their current system is not at all ready.
This project is inspired in providing a solution to a school problem. afterClassroom tries to connect the student and teachers so that education can still continue to flow even remotely.
